# Notely
Notely Quick-Note Taker is a simple note taking application for the terminal.

Notely allows you to take quick notes when you are in the terminal. When you enter the notes, everyday Notely creates a separate .txt file, and saves all your notes with timestamp. The default directory of the notes is ~/Notely Notes.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS and OS X 10.11.6 (with Homebrew).
